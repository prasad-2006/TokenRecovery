# Aptos Token Recovery Contract

A comprehensive Move-based smart contract solution on the Aptos blockchain designed to recover tokens that have been mistakenly sent to incorrect addresses, providing users with a safety net for common transaction errors.

## üöÄ Vision

In the rapidly evolving Aptos DeFi ecosystem, human error remains one of the leading causes of permanent token loss. Our Token Recovery Contract leverages Move's security features and Aptos's fast finality to create a decentralized, trustless mechanism that allows users to recover tokens sent to wrong addresses while maintaining the security and immutability principles of blockchain technology.

We envision a future where accidental token transfers on Aptos don't result in permanent loss, making blockchain technology more accessible and forgiving to both newcomers and experienced users alike.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Common scenarios where tokens are lost:
- Sending tokens to a similar-looking address (typos)
- Copying the wrong address from clipboard
- Sending tokens to smart contract addresses that don't support token recovery
- Network confusion (sending tokens on wrong blockchain)
- Exchange address mistakes

## üîß Features

### Core Functionality
- **Native Token Support**: Works with Aptos Coin (APT) and other Aptos tokens
- **Time-locked Recovery**: Implements a grace period for legitimate dispute resolution
- **Proof of Ownership**: Cryptographic verification of original sender identity using Aptos's account model
- **Message Board**: Built-in messaging system for communication between parties
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient Move module design to minimize transaction costs

### Security Features
- **Move's Security Model**: Leverages Move language's security features and resource safety
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and abuse of the recovery system
- **Safe Token Handling**: Type-safe token operations using Move's type system
- **Emergency Pause**: Safety mechanisms for critical situations

## üìã How It Works

### Recovery Process
1. **Request Submission**: User submits a recovery request with transaction proof
2. **Verification Period**: 7-day window for verification and dispute resolution
3. **Validation**: Smart contract validates ownership and transaction details
4. **Recovery Execution**: Tokens are returned to the original sender's address

### Technical Flow

## üõ† Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Aptos CLI
- Petra or other Aptos-compatible wallet
- Sufficient APT for gas fees

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prasad-2006/TokenRecovery.git
cd TokenRecovery

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile Move modules
aptos move compile

# Run Move tests
aptos move test

# Deploy to devnet
aptos move publish --named-addresses token_recovery=default
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## üíª Usage

### For End Users
1. Visit the recovery portal at `https://recovery.tokencontract.io`
2. Connect your wallet
3. Submit recovery request with transaction hash
4. Wait for verification period
5. Claim recovered tokens

### For Developers
```move
/// Interface for integration
module token_recovery {
    public entry fun submit_recovery_request(
        token_address: address,
        amount: u64,
        tx_hash: vector<u8>,
    ) acquires RecoveryCapability {
        // Implementation details
    }
    
    public entry fun claim_recovered_tokens(
        request_id: u64
    ) acquires RecoveryRequest {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

## üìä Contract Architecture

### Core Modules
- `token_recovery.move` - Main recovery logic
- `message_board.move` - Communication system
- Resources and capabilities pattern for access control

### Key Storage Structures
```move
struct RecoveryRequest has key {
    requester: address,
    token_address: address,
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    status: u8,
    tx_hash: vector<u8>,
}
```
