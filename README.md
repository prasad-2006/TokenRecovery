# Token Recovery Contract

A comprehensive smart contract solution designed to recover tokens that have been mistakenly sent to incorrect addresses, providing users with a safety net for common transaction errors in the blockchain ecosystem.

## üöÄ Vision

In the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape, human error remains one of the leading causes of permanent token loss. Our Token Recovery Contract aims to create a decentralized, trustless mechanism that allows users to recover tokens sent to wrong addresses while maintaining the security and immutability principles of blockchain technology.

We envision a future where accidental token transfers don't result in permanent loss, making blockchain technology more accessible and forgiving to both newcomers and experienced users alike.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Common scenarios where tokens are lost:
- Sending tokens to a similar-looking address (typos)
- Copying the wrong address from clipboard
- Sending tokens to smart contract addresses that don't support token recovery
- Network confusion (sending tokens on wrong blockchain)
- Exchange address mistakes

## üîß Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-token Support**: Works with any ERC-20 compatible token
- **Time-locked Recovery**: Implements a grace period for legitimate dispute resolution
- **Proof of Ownership**: Cryptographic verification of original sender identity
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanism for handling contested recovery requests
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract design to minimize transaction costs

### Security Features
- **Multi-signature Validation**: Requires multiple confirmations for recovery actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and abuse of the recovery system
- **Blacklist Protection**: Prevents recovery from known malicious addresses
- **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker for critical security situations

## üìã How It Works

### Recovery Process
1. **Request Submission**: User submits a recovery request with transaction proof
2. **Verification Period**: 7-day window for verification and dispute resolution
3. **Validation**: Smart contract validates ownership and transaction details
4. **Recovery Execution**: Tokens are returned to the original sender's address

### Technical Flow

## üõ† Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat or Truffle
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Sufficient ETH for gas fees

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/token-recovery-contract.git
cd token-recovery-contract

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## üíª Usage

### For End Users
1. Visit the recovery portal at `https://recovery.tokencontract.io`
2. Connect your wallet
3. Submit recovery request with transaction hash
4. Wait for verification period
5. Claim recovered tokens

### For Developers
```solidity
// Interface for integration
interface ITokenRecovery {
    function submitRecoveryRequest(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 txHash,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external;
    
    function claimRecoveredTokens(uint256 requestId) external;
}
```

## üìä Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts
- `TokenRecovery.sol` - Main recovery logic
- `RecoveryValidator.sol` - Proof validation system  
- `DisputeResolver.sol` - Handles contested claims
- `TokenRegistry.sol` - Manages supported tokens

### Key Storage Structures
```solidity
struct RecoveryRequest {
    address requester;
    address tokenAddress;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 timestamp;
    RecoveryStatus status;
    bytes32 txHash;
}
```
